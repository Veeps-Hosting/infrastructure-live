# Global Region Resources

This folder contains the templates that define AWS resources which are global across this entire AWS region and all
environments defined within it.

This includes resources like ECR repos, Route 53 entries, and SNS topics. The common theme is that these resources may 
be used by any of the environments (any of the VPCs) in this AWS region.
